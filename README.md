# Dating-Website

This is a website that I created for a class, CSE 330: Creative and Rapid Prototype Development.

In it, I used Python, Flask, JS, HTML and CSS to create a website that dynamically posts content, stores user data, sends emails
to users and protects from basic sql injections, CSRF tokens and other basic hacks.
